Mr. Sullivan underscored the Biden Administration’s desire to build constructive U.S.-Turkey ties, expanding areas of cooperation and managing disagreements effectively.

1,19,White House,Statement and Releases,2021-03-21,Statement by President Biden on Turkey’s Withdrawal from the Istanbul Convention,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/06/29/remarks-by-president-biden-and-president-recep-tayyip-erdogan-of-the-republic-of-turkey-before-bilateral-meeting/,"Turkey’s sudden and unwarranted withdrawal from the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence Against Women and Domestic Violence, better known as the Istanbul Convention, is deeply disappointing. Around the world, we are seeing increases in the number of domestic violence incidents, including reports of rising femicide in Turkey, the first nation to sign the convention. Countries should be working to strengthen and renew their commitments to ending violence against women, not rejecting international treaties designed to protect women and hold abusers accountable. This is a disheartening step backward for the international movement to end violence against women globally. Gender-based violence is a scourge that touches every nation in every corner of the world. In the past few weeks, we’ve seen too many examples of horrific and brutal assaults on women, including the tragic murders in Georgia. And we’ve seen the broader damage that living under the daily specter of gender-based violence does to women everywhere. It hurts all of us, and we all must do more to create societies where women are able to go about their lives free from violence."

4,17,White House,Statement and Releases,2021-06-17,On-the-Record Press Call by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on the President’s Trip to Europe,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/05/29/readout-of-president-bidens-call-with-president-erdogan-of-turkiye-2/,"On your first question, President Biden and President Erdoğan had a detailed discussion of a potential Turkish mission to secure the airport once the Resolute Support Mission has ended.  The President and President Erdoğan agreed that they would work together to make this happen. President Erdoğan indicated he would need, as you said, certain forms of support to do that.  And President Biden committed that that support would be forthcoming.  President Erdoğan expressed satisfaction with that, and the two of them tasked their teams just to work out the final details. But the clear commitment from the leaders was established that Turkey would play a lead role in securing Hamid Karzai International Airport, and we are now working through how to execute against that. Obviously, we take seriously the concern that the Taliban or other elements in Afghanistan will attack the Western — or the international presence — diplomatic presence or security presence in and around Kabul.  That’s why we are putting together a detailed and effective security plan. We do not believe that what the Taliban has said publicly should or will deter the efforts underway right now to establish that security presence, which in turn will enable international missions — diplomatic missions to operate. On the S-400, they discussed it.  There was not a resolution of the issue.  There was a commitment to continue the dialogue on the S-400.  And the two teams will be following up on that coming out of the meeting. We are feeling good about where we are in terms of the planning with the Turks on this issue.  But, of course, we are obviously also conducting contingency planning in the event that either Turkey can’t proceed — although we have every expectation they will — or can only proceed in a more limited fashion. And without going into too much detail at this point because of the sensitivity of that contingency planning, I will say that it focuses on security contractors who have extensive experience in both static and dynamic security in Afghanistan.  And that is what we are looking at as the alternative. We have scoped out what would be necessary to be able to confidently secure the airport in Kabul.  And we feel that we would have an alternative, although we are very much focused right now on converting the President’s commitments to each other — President Erdoğan and President Biden — into an action plan that sees the Turks taking the lead at HKIA. "

Turkey has been a longtime ally of the United States and of our European partners. Obviously they are a NATO ally. Even though, they are not acting like a NATO ally at this time. Nonetheless, they are in the NATO alliance. And it is very painful to see the country deteriorate as it has deteriorated and left the commitments that all of the NATO partners have had to the things that we value in NATO.The most pressing aspect of our relationship is Turkey’s acquisition and continued use of the Russian S-400 missile system. This issue remains at an impasse and has now grown to define the significant part of our relationship and it is deeply troubling. It is unacceptable that Turkey believes it can reap the benefits of NATO membership while refusing to commit to the basic principle of a cohesive, interoperable alliance. They seemed to have forgotten that NATO was formed specifically to push back against Russian aggression. Dealing with them on military purchases like this is just simply unacceptable. This is an issue I raise with Turkish leaders at every opportunity. Indeed, I had a very clear discussion with President Erdogan in person, face to face, where I laid out the precise nature of the problems created and caused by the presence of Russian-made S-400s on the soil of a NATO ally. He understood but persisted. This issue will not go away and it greatly affects our overall relationship on several fronts when it comes to NATO matters, including the F-35s. Speaking of the F-35s, after our conversation, he understood clearly that even though they’ve paid for five of them, the five have been completed and are sitting here in the United States. Those F-35s will not be delivered to Turkey so long as there are S-400 missiles on Turkish soil. The same with construction of parts for the F-35. There were 900 parts for the F-35 being produced in Turkey. That is down to a very minimal amount right now and will eventually be completely phased out. Ending on a positive note, Erdogan has appointed a new ambassador to the United States. This ambassador is very engaging and says, and I believe, that he wants to do his best to attempt to repair what is obviously a deteriorating relationship. I hope he is successful in that regard. Turkey’s recent agreement to withdraw its mercenaries from Libya also shows it has the capacity for responsible stabilization through diplomacy, but it remains to be seen whether they follow through on this commitment and it’s important that we ensure that they do. Likewise, Turkey deserves international recognition for hosting millions of Syrian refugees for the past several years. We must take a clear-eyed look at our relationship with Turkey. We can appreciate and encourage the good while clearly condemning the bad. I expect our discussions today will help us define these matters and develop a better understanding of how to address them in this emerging era."

On this somber anniversary of Turkey’s illegal invasion of Cyprus, we are reminded how the events of 1974 only served to presage Turkey’s increasingly aggressive and dangerous posture against U.S. national security interests and those of our closest allies and partners.  To be clear, Turkey’s invasion and illegal occupation in the north of Cyprus is in violation of international law and must end. But in explicitly calling for two states on the island and planning to develop Varosha despite United Nations resolutions seeking special status for the area, Ankara not only threatens the Republic of Cyprus, but the security of the entire region. Simply put, Erdogan is no friend of the United States. I look forward to working with Secretary Blinken to explore new measures that the Biden administration can take to ensure President Erdogan faces additional consequences for violating international law, and for his brazen determination to rob Cypriots from controlling their own destiny. The United States must not waver in our firm commitment to help end the tragic division of this island nation.  It is incumbent on us to make sure the world is watching, and that Ankara is held accountable."

As everyone knows, this system in not inter-operable with NATO, and Erdogan, not understandably, insists on buying – it has the S-400 missiles – which makes collaboration with NATO more difficult at best. Erdogan has claimed that we wouldn’t sell them the Patriots that are in the same class as the Russian S-400. We know that is not true. Senator Shaheen and I delivered a letter in 2012 to the Turks, at the time they were shopping, to tell them they should buy and we were ready to deliver as many as they needed. Erdogan shrugged when I handed him that letter. The human rights situation in Turkey also remains difficult. Turkey is one of the highest jailers of journalists and opposition activists in Eurasia, and has persecuted multiple locally employed staff of our U.S. mission there. This not unacceptable. To be fair, Turkey was a key collaborator in Afghanistan and our military-to-military contacts remain strong. Turkey also continues to host millions of Syrian refugees, and its cooperation is key to delivering aid and assistance to Syria"

As Russia continues its brutal and illegal invasion of Ukraine, Turkey has a responsibility and an opportunity to unequivocally demonstrate its commitment to NATO and to regional peace and security by fully rejecting any military cooperation with a war criminal like Vladimir Putin.Between continued antagonistic violations of Greece's airspace and the delaying of the accession process for Sweden and Finland's NATO membership, I sincerely hope Turkey will change course and live up to its responsibilities to the defense alliance by being the constructive partner in the region we all hope it can be. The United States must be clear: Any expansion of Turkey’s ties to the Russian defense sector would be a grave mistake that would further endanger the security of our NATO allies and partners throughout Europe"

And that’s why I’m calling for free and fair elections in Turkey. But if standing up to human rights abuses makes me an enemy of Erdogan – if calling out Turkey for arming Azerbaijan and enabling the massacre of innocent Armenian civilians makes me an enemy of Erdogan – if demanding Turkey recognize Greek and Cypriot sovereignty makes me an enemy of Erdogan – then it is a badge I will wear with honor.

We talked about the important work that we’re doing in support of Ukraine.  Türkiye has played a critical role over the last couple of years, particularly with Black Sea Grain Initiative and trying to get food out of Ukraine, as well as supporting its electricity grid.  We discussed our work to strengthen our counterterrorism partnership, to work as well at growing our economic relationship through trade and investment. And, of course, we discussed the crisis in Gaza, including the efforts to significantly expand humanitarian assistance to people in need, efforts to prevent the conflict from spreading through other parts of the region, and what we can do to set the conditions for a durable, sustainable, lasting peace for Israelis and Palestinians. On the humanitarian piece, I think we’ve made some good progress in recent days in working to expand that.  Ambassador Satterfield remains in the region working that every single day.  We’ve also had very important conversations throughout this trip with countries in the region on the role that everyone can play in making sure that the conflict doesn’t expand, doesn’t spread to other countries.  And of course, we remain very focused on the hostages held by Hamas, including Americans, in making sure we’re doing everything possible to bring them home. With regard to Sweden, we were very encouraged by the fact that President Erdogan signed the ratification protocols, sent them to parliament.  And I’m convinced that we’ll see forward movement on that.  I think there’s a shared commitment to make sure that we complete the process, that Sweden joins the Alliance.  That’s a commitment that Türkiye has, that we have, and I would expect that we’ll see that come to fruition. "

This escalation threatens the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS’s years-long progress to degrade and defeat ISIS. Recent air strikes in Syria directly threatened the safety of U.S. personnel who are working in Syria with local partners to defeat ISIS and maintain custody of more than ten thousand ISIS detainees. Moreover, uncoordinated military actions threaten Iraq’s sovereignty. Immediate de-escalation is necessary in order to maintain focus on the defeat-ISIS mission and ensure the safety and security of personnel on the ground committed to the defeat-ISIS mission. We condemn the loss of civilian life that has occurred in both Turkiye and Syria as a result of these actions and offer our condolences. We are also concerned by reports of the deliberate targeting of civilian infrastructure. As we call for de-escalation, we recognize Turkiye’s legitimate security concerns. We will continue to discuss with Turkiye and our local partners maintaining ceasefire arrangements"
60,36,Department of Defense,Statement and Releases,2023-10-05,Pentagon Press Secretary Air Force Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder Holds an On-Camera Press Briefing,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/05/29/readout-of-president-bidens-call-with-president-erdogan-of-turkiye-2/,"So earlier today, Secretary Austin spoke by phone with Turkish Minister of National Defense Yasar Guler to discuss Turkish activity in proximity to U.S. forces in Syria.  The secretary reaffirmed that the United States remains in Syria exclusively in support of the campaign to defeat ISIS. The secretary also acknowledged Türkiye's legitimate security concerns and underscored the importance of close coordination between the United States and Türkiye to prevent any risks to U.S. forces or the global coalition's Defeat ISIS mission. Separate but related, the Department of Defense also condemns the recent terrorist attack at the Turkish Interior Ministry and we wish those injured a speedy recovery.  We will post a readout of the call later today on the DOD website. Yes, so first -- first of all, just a -- a little context up front.  You know, Turkey is one of our strongest and most valued NATO allies, and that -- that partnership continues and will continue.  So this is certainly a regrettable incident. At approximately 7:30 local time in Syria today, our -- our forces had observed UAVs conducting airstrikes in the vicinity of Hasakah, Syria.  Some of those strikes were inside a declared U.S. restricted operating zone, our -- or ROZ, near Hasakah, and were approximately a kilometer away from U.S. forces who relocated to bunkers. At approximately 11:30 local time, a Turkish UAV re-entered the ROZ on a heading toward where U.S. forces were located.  U.S. commanders assessed that the UAV, which was now less than half a kilometer from U.S. forces, to be a potential threat, and U.S. F-16 fighters subsequently shot down the UAV in self-defense at approximately 11:40 local time. It's important to point out that no U.S. forces were injured during the incident.  We have no indication that -- that the -- that Turkey was intentionally targeting U.S. forces.  And as I mentioned, the secretary did talk to his Turkish counterpart and reaffirmed our commitment to continue to closely coordinate. I think, again, it's a regrettable incident but U.S. commanders on the ground did assess that there was a potential threat, and so they took prudent action in this scenario.  But again, the secretary has talked to his counterpart.  They had the opportunity to have a fruitful conversation and again commit to one another that the U.S. and Turkey will continue to closely communicate and coordinate. And -- and as I mentioned, Turkey does remain a very important and valuable NATO ally and partner to the United States. I said they were observed conducting airstrikes. They were conducting airstrikes inside a declared U.S. restricted operating zone near Hasakah. Well, I won't speak for the Turkish minister. I would say that the bottom line is it was a very productive discussion on both sides, and again, a commitment that -- that we would continue to closely coordinate to prevent putting U.S. forces at risk. A reaffirmation of the strong partnership that our two countries share and also an acknowledgement that, again, we will keep lines of communication open, particularly given that region of the world and the focus on the Defeat ISIS mission. So I don't want to get into the specifics other than to say that we have multiple channels of communication at multiple levels. As you know, U.S. forces as part of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, have been operating in that area for a while. And of course being on the border of Turkey and having U.S. forces stationed in Turkey, we have multiple ways to communicate with our -- with our Turkish allies. It -- it went to a high enough level within the operational chain of command. I'll just leave it at that. Yes, Matt. Again, based on the observation of air strikes being conducted and the fact that this drone was, you know, upwards of nearly half a kilometer from U.S. forces, U.S. commanders made the determination that it was a self-defense threat and so appropriate action was taken. Well look again, this is a regrettable incident and -- and Secretary Austin has spoken with the Minister of Defense in Turkey and -- and again, we will communicate at all levels. And so we will stay focused on the Defeat ISIS mission in Syria. That's why we're there in the first place. And so that will continue to remain our focus"
